		<h5>Practical tools to align employee and employer goals for improved corporate outcomes </h5>
		<p>Welcome to our page! We are passionate about getting the most out of your employees, while rejecting many of the practices that have become commonplace in the working world. We truly believe that it is possible, and worthwhile, to align the goals and mindsets of employers and employees to create mutual interest and fulfilment within a company.</p></div>
		<div class="dividers"><img src="../Images/Blonde.png" alt="Cartoon man achieving goals"></div>

	<h2> About Us </h2> 
    <div class="dividerone"></div>
	<div class="text-box">
	<p>We have experienced the corporate world, from being college graduates, to eventually managing teams of our own. We have experienced the pitfalls of the modern corporate world for ourselves, and navigated what it means to be a sucessful employee or manager first hand.</p>
	<p>We are passionate about our approach, which puts employees in the driving seat of their own careers, builds company loyaly, and focuses on high levels of communication between employees and managers to encourage everyone to reach their personal and professional goals.</p>
	<p>Throughout this website, we aim to provide you with the tools you need to build relationships with your employees, encourage skill progression, and take practical steps to ensure everyone involved has a clear trajectory to success.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<h2> Growth </h2> 
    <div class="dividerone"></div>
	<div class="text-box">
	<p>The clearest way in our experience to motivate an employee is to ensure they are continously growing professionally and gaining new skills. Employees who feel their career has stagnated are difficult to motivate, and ultimately both they and the company lose out.</p>
	<p>Setting clear and achievable goals is proven to increase progression rates, while keeping employees and employers focussed on the most important aspects of an individual's role. An employee should have a mixture of long term and short term goals, which are regularly reviewed and discussed.</p>
	<p>Our <a href="../Growth:Goals/GrowthGoals.html">Growth Goals</a> page sets out clear instructions for optimal goal setting, and how to monitor and achieve those goals.</p>	
	</div>
	<br>
	<h2> Projects </h2> 
    <div class="dividerone"></div>
	<div class="text-box">
	<p>Tracking and documenting the everyday work of an employee is often underestimated as a motivational tool. Having a clear record of projects and tasks completed by an employee is an easy way to monitor productivity and progression.</p> 
	<p>This is also the best way for the employee to showcase their work and capabilities. Having a concise history of their work enables managers searching for help to identify the most capable/experienced candidates. Regular feedback on completed projects also means that employees know where their strengths lie, and what areas they can work on improving for next time.</p>
	<p>Our <a href="../Projects/Projects.html">Projects</a> page provides suggestions for how to monitor current and past projects, with feedback where appropriate from others on the team.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<h2> Reviews</h2> 
    <div class="dividerone"></div>
	<div class="text-box">
	<p>Open communication between employee and manager is imperative. It is the easiest way to make both feel comfortable that tasks are being completed to the required standard, and that the employee's career is on track in line with their personal goals.</p> 
	<p>Regular scheduled reviews provide a platform for this communication, and gives both employee and manager an opportunity to voice any concerns, and also to talk about what has gone well in the last period. Recognising achievements as well and areas for improvement and keeping reviews balanced is the best way to motivate employees through their reviews.</p>
	<p>We have created a simple template in our <a href="../Comments/Comments.html">Reviews</a> page. Note that written reviews provide a written historical record of employee performance, but that continuous communication in between reviews will help to further the employee growth.</p>
